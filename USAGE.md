# üìö PassAuthStreamCipher Usage Guide

## üöÄ How to Use Your SaiSecureStreamCipher

### Method 1: GUI Application (Recommended)

1. **Launch the application:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Text Encryption Tab:**

   - Enter a strong password (you'll get real-time feedback)
   - Type your text in the input area
   - Click "Encrypt Text" to encrypt
   - Copy the encrypted text from the output area
   - To decrypt: paste encrypted text, enter same password, click "Decrypt Text"

3. **File Encryption Tab:**

   - Enter a strong password
   - Click "Browse" to select file to encrypt
   - Choose output location
   - Click "Encrypt File" or "Decrypt File"
   - Progress bar shows encryption status

4. **Security Information Tab:**
   - Read about security features
   - Learn best practices
   - Understand the algorithms used

### Method 2: Command Line Demo

```bash
python demo.py
```

This runs comprehensive demos showing:

- Password strength validation
- Text encryption/decryption
- File encryption/decryption
- Key derivation process
- Cipher internals

### Method 3: Programmatic Usage

```python
from src.crypto_engine import PassAuthStreamCipher, SecureTextProcessor

# Initialize
cipher = PassAuthStreamCipher()
text_processor = SecureTextProcessor(cipher)

# Encrypt text
encrypted = text_processor.encrypt_text("Secret message", "MyPassword123!")

# Decrypt text
decrypted = text_processor.decrypt_text(encrypted, "MyPassword123!")

# Encrypt file
cipher.encrypt_file("input.txt", "output.encrypted", "MyPassword123!")

# Decrypt file
cipher.decrypt_file("output.encrypted", "decrypted.txt", "MyPassword123!")
```

### üîí Password Guidelines

**Strong Password Examples:**

- ‚úÖ `MySecureP@ssw0rd2024!` (20 chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- ‚úÖ `Tr0ub4dor&3` (11 chars, but complex)
- ‚úÖ `correct-horse-battery-staple-42!` (34 chars, passphrase style)

**Weak Password Examples:**

- ‚ùå `password123` (too common)
- ‚ùå `12345678` (too simple)
- ‚ùå `qwerty` (too short)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

1. **SaiSecureStreamCipher**: Hand-implemented stream cipher
2. **Random Salt**: 16 bytes per encryption
3. **Random Nonce**: 12 bytes per encryption
4. **No Key Reuse**: Fresh crypto material every time

### üìÅ File Format

Encrypted files contain:

```
[Salt: 16 bytes] + [Nonce: 12 bytes] + [Iterations: 4 bytes] + [Ciphertext: variable]
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

- **NEVER** lose your password - there's no recovery
- **ALWAYS** test decryption immediately after encryption
- **BACKUP** important encrypted files
- **USE** unique passwords for different files
- **AVOID** sharing passwords over insecure channels

### üß™ Testing Your Installation

```bash
# Test core cipher
python -m src.sai_secure_stream_cipher

# Test complete system
python -m src.crypto_engine

# Test password validation
python -m src.key_derivation

```

### üéØ Real-World Usage Examples

1. **Personal Documents:**

   - Encrypt tax documents, personal letters
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Keep backups of both encrypted and password info

2. **Sensitive Files:**

   - Encrypt before uploading to cloud storage
   - Use file encryption for maximum security
   - Test decryption before deleting originals

3. **Text Messages:**
   - Encrypt sensitive text before sharing
   - Use text encryption for quick messages
   - Share encrypted text via secure channels

### üîß Troubleshooting

**GUI won't start:**

- Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
- Check if Tkinter is available: `python -c "import tkinter"`

**Encryption fails:**

- Check password strength
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Verify file permissions

**Decryption fails:**

- Check password is exactly correct
- Ensure encrypted file is complete
- Verify file wasn't corrupted

### üìû Support

For issues:

1. Check the demo works: `python demo.py`
2. Read the README.md for technical details
3. Check the Security Information tab in GUI
4. Verify against RFC 7539 test vectors
